# CS 193 Lab 1 - CS 193 Website
Throughout this lab you will create a personal GitHub account, use that GitHub account to modify some code from the Lab repository, and then submit it to us for grading! This same basic process will be used throughout CS193 to complete and turn in all of your labs, so for this first one, we're focusing on making sure you can understand the process.

### Step 1 - Set up a Personal Github Account
If you already have a personal Github account and have activated your Student Developer Pack (i.e. you can create private repositories), feel free to ignore this section.

Github is a service that combines the git version control system (remember what version control is from lecture?) with code hosting and project management services. Throughout most of your career as a Software Developer, you'll be using Github A LOT, so let's go ahead and get you set up with an account.

Hop on over to the [Github website](https://github.com/). Once you're there, click on the [Sign Up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) link in the upper right to create your account. Choose a memorable, but professional, username (you'll probably have your Github username listed on your resume and be handing it out to companies regularly). Use your Purdue email address to create this account as well. This will allow you to unlock some sweet benefits that Github gives to students for free.

Once your Github account is all set up, you need to request access to the Github Student Developer pack. To do this, navigate to the [Student Developer Pack website](https://education.github.com/pack) and follow the steps there to request access. As soon as you have access to the student benefits, you can continue on with this lab.

### Step 2 - Accept the Lab 1 Assignment
In lecture and during lab we gave out a link to follow to access Lab 1 on Github. Follow this link and click the "Accept" button to begin importing the Lab 1 repository to your personal Github account. You should receive an email when this is complete (<1 minute).

Now head on over to [github.com](https://github.com/) and (if you're logged in and everything went smoothly) you should see a new repository called **Purdue-CS193/lab-1-\<Your Github Username\>**. You will be editing some files in this repository to complete your lab.

### Step 3 - Create Your Own Website!
The repository that was just added to your Github account is already set up with a simple file that displays a basic website. The website content is found in the index.md file. Throughout this lab you will be editing this file to create your own content for this website.

To active the website so you can navigate to it, click on the **Purdue-CS193/lab-1-\<Your Github Username\>** repository from your Github home page. In the upper right corner, click on the **Settings** button. Scroll down to the section called **GitHub Pages**. Change the **Source** setting to the option called **master branch** and click save. At this point, you can navigate to ```https://purdue-cs193.github.io/lab-1-<Your Github Username>/``` to view the website you just activated!

Right now, there isn't any meaningful content in this website, just a placeholder that tells you a little about what you can do with the website template.

### Step 4 - Edit Your Website
Having just a template website is pretty boring. To edit your website to display more interesting content, go back to the main page for the **Purdue-CS193/lab-1-\<Your Github Username\>** repository.

From here, click on the **index.md** file. You should see the same content you viewed at ```https://purdue-cs193.github.io/lab-1-<Your Github Username>/``` except this time it is not themed.

To edit this file, click on the **edit** button (it looks like a little pencil) in the upper right hand corner of the file display. This will open a text editor where you can change the contents of the website to whatever you want. Take a few minutes to experiment with the different formatting tools that the website template tells you are available.

To save your changes so that they will display on your website, fill out the **Commit Changes** form by describing what you changed about the website. Select the option called **Commit directly to the master branch** and click **Commit changes**. If all is well, you should be able to navigate back to ```https://purdue-cs193.github.io/lab-1-<Your Github Username>/``` and view the changes you made.

### Step 5 - The Graded Part (**THIS PART IS WHAT WE ARE ACTUALLY GRADING**)
When you're ready, create a **heading** (a heading is some text that is preceded by a # sign) to title your website
**\<Your Name\>'s first CS193 Lab**

Next, create a bulleted list of some of your favorite things about Purdue CS193 (if you don't have any, I'll be sad :( but try to make some up anyway).

When you're done, commit your changes, just as you did above and you're done! **CONGRATULATIONS** you just completed your first CS193 Lab :) Give yourself a pat on the back and bask in the glory of your brand new fancy GitHub Website!

### Optional Extra - Change the Theme of Your Website
If you aren't a fan of the super cool hacker theme that I chose to be the default of your website, you can easily change it.
Navigate to the settings page for your **Purdue-CS193/lab-1-\<Your Github Username\>** and scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. Click on **Change theme** and pick your favorite theme!
